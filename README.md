# CS193p-Memorize
Memorize App created while following the Stanford CS193p course in SwiftUI from Spring 2021.

The goal of this project was to get an introductory knowledge of SwiftUI by following the lectures, as well as to implement my own features. Lectures got the app "functional" where cards could be flipped, and the model knows if they have been matched or not. My extensions include score-tracking logic, remembering which cards have been seen before, "you win" alert, the New Game button, named themes randomly chosen when a new game is started, and the changed score indicator. Below are screenshots from the application.

New Game with the Halloween theme:

Mismatch including 1 previously seen card:
